                  <p>Where is the fountain of youth? Does it actually exist? For thousands of years, people all over the world have been trying to do anything they can in order to not only look younger, but also stay looking younger. Creams, supplements, those funny looking facial masks, acupuncture, botox, facial reconstruction…you name it. Very recently, something called red light therapy has been all the rage with those in the beauty industry.</p>
                  <p>This piece will delve into what exactly red light therapy is. We’ll speak about the entire process in terms of what it does to your skin — as well as where one can get this ‘reverse aging’ tool.</p>
                  <h3>What is Red Light Therapy?</h3>
                  <p>Essentially, natural red light is used to penetrate skin cells. Mitochondria in the skin cells are able to absorb the light. The goal is to give these cells more energy. By doing so, the thought is that it can help in repairing skin tissue. This includes marks, scars, and other blemishes. The rejuvenation process is still in its infancy stages. However, many are quite excited about it.</p>
                  <h3>What It Does</h3>
                  <p>Reportedly, this process has been studied by a number of doctors and medical journals. The red light therapy itself is said to help in reducing against facial lines (forehead, cheeks) and wrinkles in general. By stimulating the energy in the cell, red light therapy is said to give the face more elasticity (by building up collagen). </p>
                  <p>The circulation between blood and tissue cells will increase as a result. This is what’s said to give the face a younger, more refreshed look. Some even say it could help with over complexion (should that individual have past issues with acne). Red light therapy is even said to help with muscle repair and wound healing.</p>
                  <h3>Potential Concerns</h3>
                  <p>As previously stated, this isn’t necessarily a cure for facial issues. Studies are still being done, and information is still being accrued. From a long-term effect standpoint, there’s no conclusive opinion on what could occur down the line. Reportedly, equipment could become faulty. Over-exposure to the light could ultimately lead to blistering or even burns. It’s all about keeping it in moderation.</p>
                  <h3>Buying The Tool</h3>
                  <p>A quick search engine hunt will allow for the prospective customer to purchase a number of different red light therapy tools. One should not only read the reviews of the product, but also cross-reference when it comes to a price standpoint. Many of these devices can cost hundreds of dollars (if not more).</p>
